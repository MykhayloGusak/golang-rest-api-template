## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Go 1.21+**: You'll need Go 1.21 or a later version installed. You can download and install Go from the official website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

2. **MongoDB**: You'll need a MongoDB server running locally or accessible from your development environment. You can download and install MongoDB from the official website: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

3. **Make**: Make sure you have Makefile installed. Most Unix-like systems have it pre-installed. For Windows, you can use tools like [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

OR

- **Docker**: If you prefer a containerized environment that includes MongoDB, you can use Docker. You can download and install Docker from the official website: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

   Additionally, this project includes a Docker Compose file that sets up the necessary services, including MongoDB, to run the application. Make sure you have Docker Compose installed as well: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can proceed with setting up and running the project.
